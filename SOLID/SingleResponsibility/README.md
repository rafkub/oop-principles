* a class should have only one reason to change
* if there are more reasons to change for a class, it has to be split in two classes

> _Every module, class or function in a computer program should have responsibility over a single part of that program's functionality, and it should encapsulate that part. All of that module, class or function's services should be narrowly aligned with that responsibility._ - Wikipedia
