# Inheritance

* basing a class upon another class, retaining similar implementation
* forming a hierarchy of classes

> _Inheritance is the mechanism whereby a subclass re-uses code in a base class. By default the subclass retains all of the operations of the base class, but the subclass may override some or all operations, replacing the base-class implementation with its own._ - Wikipedia
