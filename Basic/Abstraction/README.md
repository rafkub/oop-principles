# Abstraction

* handle complexity by hiding unnecessary details

> _Abstraction involves the facility to define objects that represent abstract "actors" that can perform work, report on and change their state, and "communicate" with other objects in the system._ - Wikipedia

NOTE: 
* the implemented code is an example of just one type of abstraction
* more precisely, `without-abstraction.php` is an example of lower level of abstraction and `abstraction.php` is an example of higher level of abstraction
* abstraction underpins encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism
