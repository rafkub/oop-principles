* bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data
* restricting of direct access to object's data

> _Encapsulation is used to hide the values or state of an object inside a class, preventing direct access to them by clients in a way that could expose hidden implementation details or violate state invariance maintained by the methods._ - Wikipedia
